1. Installation

    ---Move files on to the machine of choice---

    The easiest way is to use the built in too scp to move the files to the machine

        $ scp <FILE> <hostname>@<host address>:<folder location>
        $ scp file.tar.gz user@host.ip.net:~/

    This command will also ask for the destinations password if it is enabled, once the password is entered the
    file will be transferred-

    ---IMPORTANT---

    On the VM you had me used, Linux CentOS was installed, I had to install python<version>.4 to get full compatibility with
    this program and its sub systems although python 3.6 can also be used as well as 3.2

    To get the program and everything needed run these commands

        $ sudo yum install python34
        $ sudo yum install python34-devel
        $ sudo yum install python34-pip

        $ sudo python3.4 -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools

    Once that is done you can continue.

    ---END---

    Run the following command in the folder containing the .tar.gz

        $ sudo python<version> -m pip install -v FL_TaHc_001.tar.gz

        During the installation the installer will ask if you are a client or not, if so answer yes else enter n or
        just hit enter

            It will appear to be doing something with just ... as a line pressing n/y and hitting enter will
            continue the installation.

        The '-v' argument must be passed to see this output but if it is not it still accepts the same input and
        will wait until it has it.

    Once the program is installed and the dependencies are installed it is time to enable the client script in the
    sudoers file so that it can properly run nmap.

    To do this the location fo the script is required, it is built-in the program to report this location if
    it is called with no arguments. So preform the following command

        $ python<version> -m autonamp

    It should output something like

        <module 'launch_client' from '/home/FL_TaHc_001/autonmap/__main__.py'>

    ---NOTE---
    The following is important if the client is not run by sudo! To avoid many of the pitfalls of the Linux
    use sudo to run the command.
    ----------

    NON-SUDO:

    It is very important that the __main__.py be added to the sudoers file so that the nmap scans can take place.

    Copy the file directory including the script name

    Next launch the visudo tool to edit the sudoers file as follows

        $ sudo visudo

    Next is optional, create a new user just with permissions to run python<version> and the scripts and this user
    will be the one added to the sudoers file to execute the script. This user will have a background process running
    as well.

    Navigate to where you would like to add the entry in the /etc/sudoers file and in that place add the following

        <USERNAME> <HOSTNAME> = <USER TO RUN AS> NOPASSWD: <SCRIPT LOCATION>

    This will look like the following

        ALL ALL = (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/python<VERSION>/scriptloaction/__main__.py
        ALL ALL = (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/python<VERSION>/scriptloaction/launch_client.py

    Once the script is added to the sudoers files save and verify that it is there. No the program is set up
    and ready to run

    Final note, if tty is enabled on the system the script will be unable to run, the script must be allowed to run
    with out tty. To do this add the file to the sudoers file using the visudo command the the proper override

        $ sudo visudo
        --Place next under the passage added for the program in the previous instruction.
        Defaults!/<SCRIPT LOCATION> !requiretty

        -- This will look like
        Defaults!/usr/bin/python<VERSION>/scriptloaction/__main__.py !requiretty

    After being allowed to run without tty or a sudo command the scripts will be able to execute the proper
    nmap scans.

    Then add the client to the cron tasks by doing

        $ autonmap cron

    SUDO:

    Add the job to the cron jobs of sudo, it as easy as the following

        $ sudo autonmap cron

    This will add a cron job to the cron tab in sudo, the task will have sudo permissions and the output will be saved
    in the /root/autonmap folder


2. Running and Editing Settings.ini

    ---NOTE---
    Before running the script the localhost default of the server must match the local ip address of the host machine
    So if the host machine is assigned an address of 10.0.0.4 it must be set as such in the server_settings.ini file

    Also the port must be accessible from outside the network so port forward to that port of the server machine

    Once both of these are set then the clients will be able to contact the server.

    Also the client ip address must be set to the host address it can be done in ip address form or the host
    name, as long as the host name is resolvable

    So both of these formats would work

        10.0.0.4
    ----------

    To run the program type the following command into the terminal

        $ python<version> -m autonmap <server|client> <start|stop|update|report>

    Each component can also be run as follows

        $ python<version> -m autonamp-client
        $ python<version> -m autonmap-server

        OR

        $ autonmap <server|client> <start|stop|update|report>

        Both of these commands run the actual process in the terminal, the
            $ python<version> -m automap server start
        This command can be used to create a manual server but the server is currently a process so
        it should always run
        To check run the following command
            $ service autonmap status

    The start command is the only command that the client accepts.

    TODO: Add ability to edit config ini on web interface along with report data

    The default server setting is the local host on port 12990 and the client is set to default to that as well.
    Once the server is active the client is completely able to fulfill its task of sniffing out networks assigned in
    the work.txt file.

    All config files and work files are located in the ~/autonmap folder, if the program is run from sudo then it will
    be in the /root/autonmap folder

    As the default client is configured to run from sudo all automated scans will be located in the /root/autonmap
    folder

    Important Files are:

        autonmap/settings.ini
        autonmap/server_settings.ini
        autonmap/options.txt
