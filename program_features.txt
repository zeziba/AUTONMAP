    Server
        Automatic Service
            Restarts server after restart or crash
        Reporting of data inside of the servers database
        Automatic connection handling
            Threaded connections to handle multiple connections at once
        Database to store data from client machines
            Ability to store partial data from client if connection was reset in transmission
            Database located at autonmap/server.sqlite
        Ability to change server ip address and port
            Done through autonmap/server_settings.ini - server_ip, server_port
        Server status reporting
            with the command
                sudo service autonmap status

    Client
        Use nmap with elevated privileges to conduct through scans of a target
        Three form scan
            1st scan locates easy to find hosts on a specified network with the built-in nmap host discovery
                It then scans for the most common open ports of the host machine
            2nd Scan for uncommon ports on target machine
            3rd Scan all ports on all non-discovered hosts from the first step
                This allows the autonmap program to quickly gather data on a target network and then
                move on to the more difficult hosts which could take a very long time
        Automatic Connection Handling
            Connects to server to gather work and report completed work
        Database to store data from scan as a redundancy to the server
        Ability to change server key functions of the client
            Add/remove extra scans from nmap
                Each line of the following gives one extra command to have nmap conduct
                file is autonmap/options.txt
            Ability to change server
                autonmap/settings.ini - server_ip, server_port
            Ability to change max thread count of client
                autonmap/settings.ini - max workers
            Ability to change default nmap scan parameters
                autonmap/settings.ini - argument
            Ability to change max timeout for connections to server
                autonmap/settings.ini - Max_Timeout_Sec

    Cron
        Sets up a cron task to run on client machine so that scans will take place at the interval specified in
            the autonmap/settings.ini - scantime_hours
